# Cat Weight Histogram

In order to determine whether my sister's male cat was overweight or not, I decided to find a dataset of cat weights and visualize them in histogram form to see where my sister's cat fell on it. Below are the final two histograms. The first one is the weigh (in kilograms) of the body weight of a male cat. The second is the weight (in kilograms) of the body weight of a female cat:

Male Cats

Female Cats

My sisters cat was 6.8 pounds, which seems super heavy according to this dataset. However, this cat dataset was collected in 1947, even though it appears to be the most cited publications for cat weights. I found a newer publication from 2015 that studied cat weights in Australia, which found the following histogram:
